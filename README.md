# GNX App Project - Open for HacktoberFest

This is the project for GNX App to be built using Flutter. It is open for HacktoberFest 2k20. We are welcoming meaningful contributions to the project. The fastest way to get your PR accepted in to this is to create a PR with a public link to the APK so that the developers may be able to check your layout and style. The winning layout will get developer credits in the final version of the App.

## Getting Started
To get started, follow these steps:-
1. Fork this repository.
2. Switch to the branch containing your layout of choice. If you want to propose a new full layout, create a branch with format - "<your_github_id>-gnxapp-newlayout" in your fork and commit to that branch. If you want to propose changes to an existing layout, switch to that layout's branch in your fork and commit to it. There is an additional **misc** branch in this repo for any miscellaneous changes that you might want to propose.
3. Once you have completed your task, open a PR from your fork's branch to the same branch of this repo. Incase you have created and worked on a new branch, you may open a PR to the **new-layouts** branch or create a branch of your own name in the PR.
4. Include the screenshots to your layout in the description of your PR and a public link to the APK. We will review your PR and APK before merging or rejecting.

**Note**: We are open for HacktoberFest and are welcoming contributors to this project. In case you want to create any changes to the documentation / README please open a PR to the **misc** branch.
